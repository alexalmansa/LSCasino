# LSCasino

Code for PIC18F4321 written in C. Simulates a casino roulette.


Programming done by using co-operative systems, where we have different motors/tasks to do, and we have each motor do a small subtask and then continue to the next motor. This done at a fast frequency, allows us to execute different task in a simulated parallel way.
